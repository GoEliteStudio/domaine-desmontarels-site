    "overview": [
      "Villa Kassandra is a privately owned, fully reconstructed beachfront estate on the Kassandra Peninsula in Halkidiki, Greece, offered for sale as a freehold asset. The property occupies a ~2,500 m² seafront plot that borders the coastline directly, with an approximate distance of 60 meters from the villa to the sandy shoreline and no road separating the house from the beach. The total built area is around 750 m², of which roughly 360 m² is interior living space, complemented by approximately 280 m² of balconies and verandas, a 90 m² enclosed garage and a 20 m² technical room. The layout combines the scale and infrastructure of a small boutique hotel with the privacy of a single-family villa.",
      "The reconstruction used high-end materials such as marble, onyx and other natural stones for both interior and exterior surfaces. All major rooms are equipped with Daikin air-conditioning units, and solar panels support the energy system, improving efficiency and running costs. Outside, a two-section pool (adult/children), landscaped gardens, fountains and a 40 m² gazebo with BBQ create a resort-style environment suitable for private enjoyment, extended family use or high-end rental operations. Architecturally, the villa follows a classic, symmetrical style with generous balconies and verandas oriented toward the sea, maximizing light, views and sunset exposure.",
      "For a buyer, Villa Kassandra offers three combined advantages that are increasingly rare in Halkidiki: a true sandy beachfront plot with no road in between, a large and already reconstructed built area with quality finishes, and a location on one of northern Greece's most established and liquid holiday coastlines."
