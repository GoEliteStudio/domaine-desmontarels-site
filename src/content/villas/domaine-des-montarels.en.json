      "a": "Béziers (BZR) is mainly served by Ryanair and Volotea, offering seasonal and year-round routes from cities across the UK and northern Europe. Montpellier (MPL) is served by Transavia, Volotea, easyJet, Air France, KLM and others, with direct connections to major European cities. Routes vary slightly each season, so we recommend checking current schedules when planning."

    {
      "category": "Airports & Flights – Europe & UK",
      "q": "Can we arrive by high-speed train from Paris or Barcelona?",
      "a": "Yes. High-speed TGV services run from Paris to Béziers in roughly 4 hours and from Barcelona via Narbonne. From Béziers station, it’s about a 20-minute taxi or rental-car journey to the estate, making this a very comfortable and scenic option."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ground Transport & Transfers",
      "q": "How much is a taxi or private transfer from Montpellier Airport?",
      "a": "As a general guideline, a private taxi or transfer from Montpellier Airport (MPL) to Domaine des Montarels ranges from approximately €80 to €120 one-way depending on vehicle type and time of day. Luxury minivans for groups are typically slightly higher. We are happy to organise quotes and pre-book transfers for you."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ground Transport & Transfers",
      "q": "Is ride-sharing (such as Uber) available in the region?",
      "a": "Ride-sharing services such as Uber operate in Montpellier and Béziers, but coverage in small villages and rural areas can be limited—especially for pickups at the estate. For arrivals and departures, we recommend pre-booking a taxi or private transfer to avoid delays."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ground Transport & Transfers",
      "q": "Can we reach the villa using public transport?",
      "a": "It is possible to combine regional trains and buses to reach Alignan-du-Vent via Béziers and Pézenas, but this solution is slower and less convenient, particularly with luggage or children. Most guests prefer a rental car or a private transfer for comfort and flexibility."
    },
    {
      "category": "Ground Transport & Transfers",
      "q": "Is driving in the region straightforward for visitors?",
      "a": "Yes. Roads are well maintained and clearly signposted, and GPS navigation makes driving very simple. The A9 motorway connects major cities, and local roads wind gently through vineyards and villages. Motorway tolls are easy to pay by card or cash at the booths."
    },
    {
      "category": "Stay Duration & Experience",
      "q": "What is the ideal length of stay at Domaine des Montarels?",
      "a": "While a long weekend can offer a wonderful introduction, most groups find that 5–7 nights is the sweet spot to truly relax, visit several vineyards, explore Pézenas and Béziers, enjoy a beach day or two and still have time to simply do nothing by the pool. For deeper immersion in the region’s food, wine and culture, many guests choose 10–14 nights or even longer."
    },
    {
      "category": "Stay Duration & Experience",
      "q": "Why is the estate especially suited to longer villa holidays?",
      "a": "Domaine des Montarels is designed as a comfortable home base rather than a simple overnight stop. With its private pool, spacious interiors, fully equipped kitchen, fast Wi-Fi, gardens and local concierge support, it naturally invites week-long or extended stays where you can unpack, slow down and live like a local in southern France."
    },
    {
      "category": "Stay Duration & Experience",
      "q": "Is Domaine des Montarels better as a quick stop or a home base?",
      "a": "The estate is designed as a true home base rather than a one-night stop. You unpack once and use the villa as your private hub for vineyards, Pézenas, Béziers, Carcassonne, the Étang de Thau and the Mediterranean beaches. Over a week or more, this feels far more relaxed and luxurious than changing hotels every couple of days."
    },
    {
      "category": "Stay Duration & Experience",
      "q": "Do you offer preferential conditions for extended stays or month-long visits?",
      "a": "Yes. For longer stays (generally 10 nights or more), we can often offer preferential pricing or added-value extras such as mid-stay housekeeping, a curated selection of local wines, or flexible check-in/out where availability allows. For month-long or seasonal stays, we can tailor services, cleaning schedules and local experiences to your group’s rhythm."
    },
    {
      "category": "Region & Seasons",
      "q": "When is the best time of year to visit?",
      "a": "Each season offers something special. Spring (April–June) brings mild temperatures, wildflowers and quieter beaches. Summer (July–August) is warm and vibrant, ideal for pool days and coastal outings. Autumn (September–October) is beloved for grape harvest, golden vineyards and comfortable weather. Winter stays are peaceful and cosy, with fewer crowds and plenty of culture, markets and wine experiences."
    },
    {
      "category": "Region & Seasons",
      "q": "What is the climate like in the Languedoc region?",
      "a": "The area enjoys a classic Mediterranean climate: hot, dry summers; mild, sunny springs and autumns; and relatively gentle winters. Expect plenty of sunshine, especially from May to October. Evenings can be cooler outside of high summer, so we recommend packing a light jacket or wrap."
    },
    {
      "category": "Region & Seasons",
      "q": "Are there notable festivals or events we should know about?",
      "a": "Yes. Highlights include the Béziers Feria in August, various wine and jazz festivals, summer concerts in château courtyards, and traditional markets and brocantes throughout the year.

    },
    {
      "category": "Wine & Vineyards",
      "q": "Is the villa located in a wine region?",
      "a": "Yes. Domaine des Montarels is in the heart of the Languedoc, the world’s largest wine-producing region. The surrounding countryside is dominated by vineyards belonging to appellations such as Côtes de Thongue and AOP Pézenas, making it a fantastic base for wine-focused holidays."
    },
    {
      "category": "Wine & Vineyards",
      "q": "Do you offer private wine tours?",
      "a": "Yes. We can curate private half-day or full-day wine tours. Unlike standard group excursions, our recommendations focus on independent domaines and family-run estates, often including visits that are normally reserved for insiders or by-appointment tastings."
    },
    {
      "category": "Wine & Vineyards",
      "q": "What kind of wine experiences can we expect?",
      "a": "Depending on season and interest, you might walk through the vines with a winemaker, tour production facilities, taste Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blends, and enjoy relaxed dégustations under the trees. We can also arrange vineyard picnics, food-and-wine pairings and cellar-door purchases to enjoy back at the villa."
    },
    {
      "category": "Dining & Gastronomy",
      "q": "Can you recommend local restaurants?",
      "a": "Absolutely. We share our personal ‘little black book’ of restaurants—from authentic village bistros in Alignan-du-Vent and Pézenas to atmospheric wine bars and modern kitchens in Béziers. Many of these places are loved by locals and remain well under the mainstream tourist radar."
    },
    {
      "category": "Dining & Gastronomy",
      "q": "Is there fine dining nearby?",
      "a": "Yes. The region boasts several Michelin-starred and Gault&Millau-recognised restaurants. We can help you secure reservations at standout addresses in Béziers, Pézenas and on the coast, depending on your tastes and dates."
    },
    {
      "category": "Dining & Gastronomy",
      "q": "Where is the best local market?",
      "a": "The Saturday market in nearby Pézenas (about 10 minutes away) is legendary. It takes over the entire historic centre with stalls selling local cheeses, charcuterie, olives (especially Lucques), seasonal fruits and vegetables, flowers and antiques."
    },
    {
      "category": "Dining & Gastronomy",
      "q": "Can we enjoy fresh seafood during our stay?",
      "a": "Yes. We are close to the Étang de Thau, famous for its Bouzigues oysters and mussels. We can arrange an oyster tasting platter at the villa or a trip to the oyster beds and waterside restaurants overlooking the lagoon."
    },
    {
      "category": "Beaches & Mediterranean Coast",
      "q": "Which beaches do you recommend?",
      "a": "Our guests particularly enjoy the wide sandy beaches of Valras-Plage and Sérignan, as well as the more developed stretches and beach clubs of Cap d’Agde. Each has a slightly different personality—from family-friendly to stylish and social—so we’re happy to guide you based on the vibe you’re looking for."
    },
    {
      "category": "Beaches & Mediterranean Coast",
      "q": "Are the beaches crowded in summer?",
      "a": "In July and August, the most popular beaches can be lively, especially at midday and on weekends. With a car, it’s easy to time your visits for mornings or late afternoons, or to seek out quieter stretches of coast. We can suggest less crowded options and favourite spots for sunsets and apéritifs by the sea."
    },
    {
      "category": "Nightlife & Entertainment",
      "q": "Is there nightlife nearby?",
      "a": "Yes. You’ll find sophisticated wine bars and lively cafés in Pézenas and Béziers, summer soirées in nearby châteaux, and seasonal events at beach clubs along the coast. We can point you to places that match your preferred energy—whether that’s relaxed glasses of wine or late-night dancing."
    },
    {
      "category": "Nightlife & Entertainment",
      "q": "What is the general vibe of the local nightlife?",
      "a": "The atmosphere tends to be stylish and relaxed rather than wild. Think courtyard wine bars, open-air concerts, summer parties at vineyards and occasional DJ nights at beach clubs—perfect for groups who enjoy good music, great wine and a beautiful setting."
    },
    {
      "category": "History & Culture",
      "q": "Is there much history and culture in the area?",
      "a": "Yes. Béziers, about 20 minutes away, is considered one of the oldest towns in France, with roots predating the Romans. The region is rich in medieval villages, Roman remains, churches and traditional markets, offering plenty to see beyond the vineyard and the pool."
    },
    {
      "category": "History & Culture",
      "q": "What are the must-see historical sites?",
      "a": "Top highlights include the 9 Locks of Fonseranes on the Canal du Midi (a UNESCO-listed site), the Saint-Nazaire Cathedral in Béziers, and the beautifully preserved streets of Pézenas where Molière once performed. Carcassonne’s fortified citadel is also highly recommended for a full-day outing."
    },
    {
      "category": "History & Culture",
      "q": "Can we visit Carcassonne from the villa?",
      "a": "Yes. The medieval citadel of Carcassonne is roughly a 1 hour 20 minute drive from Domaine des Montarels. Many guests enjoy combining the visit with a scenic lunch stop, making it an excellent day trip."
    },
    {
      "category": "Villa Amenities",
      "q": "Is the pool private?",
      "a": "Yes. You have exclusive use of a private heated swimming pool set within the estate’s landscaped Mediterranean gardens. It’s the perfect place for lazy afternoons, family fun and long, sociable evenings outdoors."
    },
    {
      "category": "Villa Amenities",
      "q": "Is there high-speed Wi-Fi?",

      "a": "Yes. The kitchen is designed for food lovers, with modern appliances, quality cookware and ample workspace for preparing meals with produce from local markets. We can also arrange a private chef for special dinners or to take care of most of the cooking during your stay."
    },
    {
      "category": "Service & Staff",
      "q": "Do the hosts live on site?",
      "a": "No. Your hosts live nearby rather than in the villa itself, offering the ideal balance between complete privacy and having someone close at hand if you need recommendations, help with bookings or assistance during your stay."
    },
    {
      "category": "Service & Staff",
      "q": "Can you organise grocery stocking before we arrive?",
      "a": "Yes. On request, we can stock the fridge with essentials such as breakfast items, snacks, soft drinks and local wines so that you can begin your holiday immediately upon arrival without needing to visit a supermarket straight away."
    },
    {
      "category": "Families & Children",
      "q": "Is the villa suitable for children and multi-generational groups?",
      "a": "Yes. Domaine des Montarels works very well for families and multi-generational stays. The pool, gardens, generous living spaces and nearby attractions provide plenty to do for all ages. On request we can provide cots, high chairs and suggestions for family-friendly beaches, markets and activities."
    },
    {
      "category": "Families & Children",
      "q": "Are there kid-friendly activities in the area?",
      "a": "There are many. Families enjoy beach days, boat trips, tree-top adventure parks, the Dinosaur Museum in Mèze, bike rides along the Canal du Midi and simply exploring medieval streets, markets and squares together."
    },
    {
      "category": "Activities & Outdoor Adventures",
      "q": "Can we play golf nearby?",
      "a": "Yes. Golf Saint-Thomas near Béziers (around 15–20 minutes from the villa) offers an 18-hole course in a natural Mediterranean setting. There are additional courses along the coast for guests who wish to explore further."
    },
    {
      "category": "Activities & Outdoor Adventures",
      "q": "Is the area good for cycling or hiking?",
      "a": "The region is excellent for both. You can enjoy flat, easy rides along the Canal du Midi towpaths or tackle rolling vineyard hills. There are also scenic walking trails from the estate and in nearby nature areas. We can help organise bike rental and provide suggested routes."
    },
    {
      "category": "Remote Work & Retreats",
      "q": "Is the villa suitable for remote work, creative retreats or small team gatherings?",
      "a": "Yes. With fast Wi-Fi, quiet indoor and outdoor workspaces and a peaceful setting among the vines, Domaine des Montarels is ideal for combining holiday time with remote work or hosting a small off-site. We can help configure spaces for workshops, planning sessions or creative retreats."
    },
    {
      "category": "Remote Work & Retreats",
      "q": "Can you provide extra desks or basic office equipment?",
      "a": "We can usually provide extra tables, comfortable chairs and extension leads to create dedicated workstations. If you have specific requirements for a team retreat—such as flipcharts or an external screen—please let us know in advance so we can explore options."
    },
    {
      "category": "Booking & Logistics",
      "q": "What is the check-in/check-out time?",
      "a": "Standard check-in is from 4:00 pm and check-out is by 10:00 am. For longer stays or off-peak dates, we will always try to offer flexibility where possible. Please share your travel plans in advance so we can advise on the best options for arrival and departure."
    },
    {
      "category": "Booking & Logistics",
      "q": "Is there a minimum stay requirement?",
      "a": "Minimum stay requirements vary by season, but the property is primarily set up for relaxed villa holidays rather than short overnights. Many guests stay a full week or longer. For your specific dates, please contact us and we will confirm the minimum stay and availability."
    },
    {
      "category": "Booking & Logistics",
      "q": "Do I need a visa to visit France?",
      "a": "Citizens of many countries—including the EU, UK, USA and Canada—can visit France without a visa for short stays of up to 90 days. Travellers from some non-EU countries may also need to complete a simple online travel authorisation (such as ETIAS) before arrival once fully implemented. Because entry rules can change, we recommend checking the latest guidance from official French or EU government sources for your nationality before travelling."
    },
    {
      "category": "Sustainability & Environment",
      "q": "Does the estate follow sustainability practices?",
      "a": "Yes. The Domaine is committed to responsible water and energy use, supporting local producers and winemakers, and encouraging guests to explore the area in a thoughtful, low-impact way—through local markets, wine tourism, cycling and off-season stays whenever possible."
    },
    {
      "category": "Sustainability & Environment",
      "q": "How can we make our trip to Domaine des Montarels more sustainable?",
      "a": "Simple choices make a real difference: consider longer stays instead of multiple short trips, combine train and car travel where possible, choose hybrid or electric vehicles, enjoy locally produced food and wine, and travel outside the busiest peak weeks. We are happy to share further ideas tailored to how you plan to travel and explore the region."
    },
    {
      "category": "Restaurants & Local Dining",
      "q": "How close are the nearest restaurants to Domaine des Montarels?",
      "a": "You don’t have to drive far to eat well. Within 5–10 minutes of the estate you’ll find charming village bistros and farm-to-table kitchens in Alignan-du-Vent, Pézenas and the surrounding countryside. Relais Chantovent, La Ferme des 5 Saisons and other local gems are all easy lunch or dinner options without committing to a long drive."
    },
    {
      "category": "Restaurants & Local Dining",
      "q": "Can we walk from the villa to restaurants in Alignan-du-Vent?",
      "a": "Yes. Alignan-du-Vent is a small wine village and several cafés, bars and casual restaurants are reachable on foot or by a very short drive, depending on your preferences and mobility. Many guests enjoy an early evening stroll through the vines or village streets before dinner and then walk home under the stars."
    },
    {
      "category": "Restaurants & Local Dining",
      "q": "Which restaurant do you recommend for our first night?",
      "a": "For a relaxed yet memorable first evening, we usually suggest a nearby village bistro or wine bar—such as a cosy spot in Alignan-du-Vent or Pézenas—where you can ease into local flavours without a long journey. We can make a reservation, share directions and arrange a taxi if you prefer not to drive after your travel day."
    },
    {
      "category": "Restaurants & Local Dining",
      "q": "Are there gourmet or Michelin-level restaurants within easy reach of the villa?",
      "a": "Yes. Within 30–50 minutes’ drive you’ll find highly rated gastronomic tables, including Michelin-starred and Bib Gourmand addresses in Béziers, Villeveyrac, Montpellier and along the Étang de Thau. Domaine des Montarels is perfectly placed for a week where you alternate relaxed meals at home with a couple of truly special restaurant evenings."
    },
    {
      "category": "Restaurants & Local Dining",
      "q": "Can you organise a restaurant itinerary for a foodie week?",
      "a": "Absolutely. For guests staying 5–7 nights or more, we can design a curated dining itinerary that might include a market lunch in Pézenas, a seafood evening overlooking the Étang de Thau, a vineyard table lunch and one or two gastronomic dinners. We tailor suggestions to your group’s tastes, budget and dietary preferences."
    },
    {
      "category": "Restaurants & Local Dining",
      "q": "Are vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free diets easy to accommodate in local restaurants?",
      "a": "Yes. Many restaurants in Pézenas, Béziers and the wider Hérault now offer thoughtful vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options, often based on seasonal market produce. When we help with reservations, we can flag your requirements so that chefs are prepared in advance."
    },
    {
      "category": "Restaurants & Local Dining",
      "q": "Can we combine the Pézenas Saturday market with lunch in town and dinner back at the villa?",
      "a": "That’s one of the best ways to experience the region. Many guests spend Saturday morning at the Pézenas market (10 minutes from the estate), enjoy a light lunch in the historic centre, then return to Domaine des Montarels with baskets of local produce and wine for a leisurely home-cooked dinner or chef-prepared feast by the pool."
    },
    {
      "category": "Restaurants & Local Dining",
      "q": "Is it realistic to explore different restaurants every night if we stay a full week?",
      "a": "Yes. A one- or two-week stay easily supports a different culinary experience every evening—from simple village plates and wine bars to chic seaside terraces and formal gastronomic dining. The villa’s central location means you can keep driving times modest while still tasting the best of the region."
    },
    {
      "category": "Wine, Oysters & the Étang de Thau",
      "q": "How far is the Étang de Thau for oysters and seafood lunches?",
      "a": "The Étang de Thau, famous for Bouzigues oysters and mussels, is around 35–45 minutes from the villa depending on your chosen village. Many guests plan a day that combines a scenic drive, an oyster-tasting lunch over the water and a gentle walk before heading back to the estate for sunset by the pool."
    },
    {
      "category": "Wine, Oysters & the Étang de Thau",
      "q": "Can you link a vineyard visit with an oyster tasting on the same day?",
      "a": "Yes. A classic Languedoc day from Domaine des Montarels is to start with a late-morning vineyard tasting inland, then continue to the Étang de Thau for oysters, mussels and crisp Picpoul de Pinet by the water. We can help time reservations and suggest scenic driving routes between the two."
    },
    {
      "category": "Nightlife & Evenings Out",
      "q": "Where should we go for a relaxed drink in the evening?",
      "a": "For low-key evenings, Pézenas and Béziers offer excellent wine bars, terraces and cafés within 10–20 minutes of the villa. You can enjoy a glass of Languedoc red or a chilled rosé al fresco, then return to the calm of the estate whenever you’re ready to unwind."
    },
    {
      "category": "Nightlife & Evenings Out",
      "q": "Is there livelier nightlife within driving distance?",
      "a": "If your group wants at least one energetic night out, Cap d’Agde’s summer beach clubs and bars are around 25–30 minutes away, while Béziers and Montpellier offer more urban options such as cocktail bars and live music. The advantage of staying at the villa is that you can choose nightlife when you’re in the mood, then retreat to complete peace and quiet afterwards."
    },
    {
      "category": "Nightlife & Evenings Out",
      "q": "Is it better to stay in Béziers or at the villa if we enjoy nights out?",
      "a": "For most groups, a villa base works far better. By day you enjoy private space, the pool, vineyards and countryside, and by night you can dip into town for dinner and drinks, then return to a restful, quiet setting. Taxis and designated drivers keep evenings easy without sacrificing comfort or privacy."
    },
    {
      "category": "Experiences & Day Trips",
      "q": "What are the most popular day trips from Domaine des Montarels?",
      "a": "Guest favourites include: Pézenas (10 minutes) for markets and history; Béziers (20 minutes) for the Canal du Midi locks and cathedral; Lake Salagou (about 30 minutes) for hiking and kayaking; Cap d’Agde for beach days; and Carcassonne for a full-day medieval adventure. The estate is intentionally positioned so you can build a varied programme over a week or more."
    },
    {
      "category": "Experiences & Day Trips",
      "q": "Is Lake Salagou worth the drive from the villa?",
      "a": "Very much so. Lake Salagou offers striking red-ochre landscapes, swimming, picnicking, gentle hikes and water sports in an otherworldly setting. It is about 30–40 minutes from Domaine des Montarels and makes an excellent full-day or half-day outing, especially for families and active groups."
    },
    {
      "category": "Experiences & Day Trips",
      "q": "Can you suggest a classic 3-day itinerary built around the villa?",
      "a": "A popular three-day starter plan is: Day 1 – Pézenas market, lunch in town, afternoon by the pool, dinner at a nearby bistro. Day 2 – Vineyard visits and tasting, sunset apéritif at the villa, private chef dinner. Day 3 – Beach or Étang de Thau oysters, then a relaxed evening in Béziers or back at the estate. Longer stays simply expand this rhythm with more excursions and restaurant experiences."
    },
    {
      "category": "Experiences & Day Trips",
      "q": "Is Domaine des Montarels a good base for a full week of exploring Hérault?",
      "a": "Yes. The estate is centrally located so that most of the region’s highlights—vineyards, historic towns, beaches, lake landscapes and cultural sites—are within 20–60 minutes. A week or longer gives you time to explore deeply without changing hotels, unpack once and come ‘home’ to familiar surroundings each evening."
    },
    {
      "category": "Experiences & Day Trips",
      "q": "Can you help us balance quiet villa days with excursions so we don’t over-schedule?",
      "a": "Of course. Many guests appreciate having a loose structure that alternates pool or villa days with fuller excursion days. We can help design a plan that suits your group’s energy—perhaps one or two big outings (Carcassonne, Lake Salagou) combined with several half-day trips and lazy afternoons at the estate."
    },
    {
      "category": "Groups, Celebrations & Longer Stays",
      "q": "Is the villa suitable for multi-generational family holidays or group celebrations?",
      "a": "Yes. With multiple bedrooms, generous indoor and outdoor spaces and a private pool, the estate is ideal for multi-generational trips, milestone birthdays, anniversaries and small gatherings of friends. Being close to top restaurants, vineyards and excursions means everyone can find their version of the perfect day before reconnecting at the villa in the evening."
    },
    {
      "category": "Groups, Celebrations & Longer Stays",
      "q": "Why does a villa like Domaine des Montarels work better than a hotel for a week in this region?",
      "a": "A villa stay lets your group spread out, keep a relaxed schedule and truly live in the landscape rather than just visit it. You can shop at markets, cook or bring in a chef, linger by the pool, work remotely if needed and then head out to restaurants, beaches and vineyards when you wish. Over a week or longer, this rhythm usually feels more luxurious and personal than a conventional hotel stay."
    },
    {
      "category": "Groups, Celebrations & Longer Stays",
      "q": "Do you recommend Domaine des Montarels as a base for exploring both inland villages and the Mediterranean coast?",
      "a": "Yes. The estate sits in exactly the right position to experience the best of both worlds: inland wine country with Pézenas, Béziers and Lake Salagou on one side, and the Mediterranean coastline—Cap d’Agde, Valras-Plage, Sérignan and the Étang de Thau—on the other. A stay of 7–10 nights or more allows you to enjoy both in depth without feeling rushed."
